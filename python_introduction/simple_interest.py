#A program to compute simple interest earned on an investment over a period of time.

#Declare Variables and assign values
principal = 1000
rate = 0.05
time = 3

#Simple Interest formula(Interest= Principal * Rate * Time)
#let interest be the variable

interest = principal * rate * time
print(f"principal: {principal}")
print(f"rate: {rate}")
print(f"time: {time}")

#Output
print("The simple interest is", [interest])
